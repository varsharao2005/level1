#**Task 1: 3D Printing**

We used  Thingyverse, a website on Google for downloading the STL file of the object we wanted to print. After downloading the STL file we opened it using Creality slicer and sliced it after setting the different conditions to the standard. Then we proceeded to slice it after previewing it and making the desired changes in its dimensions. Then we save the sliced file in G-code format and upload this G-code file to the SD card which is then loaded into the 3D printer. In the presence of a coordinator, the printer's settings are adjusted. Then begins the process of printing. I tried printing a Slytherin bookmark.

#**Task 2: API**
We learnt what Application Programming  Interface was and how it worked. I did a currency converter API project that showed the value of the input value of any currency in the desired currency. I created 5 files, first one containing the html code, second one containing the css code, third one containing the javascript code, fourth one containing my API key and the fifth one containing the dropdown codes. I downloaded my API key from [this link. ](https://www.exchangerate-api.com/)

#**Task 3: Working with Git-hub** 
We learnt that Git-hub was a version control system, which could save the history of your codes and projects and also allow multiple people to work on the same project simultaneously. We created our profiles and did the required task of opening a pull request proposing to fix the issue. We forked the task repo and committed the required changes and sent a pull request.

#**Task 4: Get familiar with the command line on ubuntu and do the following subtasks:**
We worked on Ubuntu. Using the given resource article, we created 2600 files inside a folder. I created a folder named vrr2 and created 2600 files in it.

#**Task 5: Kaggle contest**
We created an account on Kaggle and took part in the Titanic - Machine Learning from Disaster Competition. My  accuracy in the survival prediction was 77.511% We did the analysis of data using python and machine learning. We predicted using different factors like age, gender, etc. I used the resource article.

#**Task 7: Create a Portfolio Webpage**
I created a portfolio using css and html. [This is my profile.](file:///C:/Users/shrih/OneDrive/Desktop/portfolio/.vscode/vrr_profile.html)
[This is my github repository containing the code for the same.](https://github.com/varsharao2005/draco_malfoy.git)

#**Task 8: Writing Resource Article using Markdown**
I learnt how to use markdown.

#**Task 9: Tinkercad**
I learnt how to use Tinkercad and simulated the following using ultrasonic/infrared sensors; to estimate the distance between an obstacle and the sensor and display the results on a LCD screen. [This is simulation](https://www.tinkercad.com/things/8Vw1TbkfrCl-copy-of-ultrasonic-sensor-distance-measurer/editel?tenant=circuits)

#**Task 10: Speed Control of DC Motor**
We used the L298 motor driver and ardiuno board. We tried assembling the circuit first on tinkercad then proceeded to perform the hardware task. We uploaded the code ARduino IDE. 

#**Task 11: LED Toggle Using ESP32**
We used ESP32 and created a webserver with ESPP32 which could control the LED via the GPIO pins. We refered to the resource article to understand the working of ESP32 and assemble the basic circuit.

#**Task 12: Soldering Pre-requisites**
We learnt how to solder. Using the soldering tool and the tin wire. We were told about perf board and the flux as well. We tried to light up an L.E.D and used resistor so as to not provide excess current to the L.E.D and prevent it from being damaged. The L.E.D has a longer end; i.e anode(+ve) and a shorter end; i.e. cathode(-ve). We first learnt what a perf board was and then soldered an L.E.D and then soldered a resistor in a way; such that the resistor and L.E.D were connected. Then we connected a battery; with its one end connected to the resistor and the other to L.E.D. We also learnt that the tin wire has an outer oxide layer to prevent the inner part from damaging. We were also asked to prevent inhaling the fumes produced while soldering because they are toxic and if inhaled on a regular basis; could also be carcinogenic. 

#**Task 13: Design a 555 astable multivibrator with duty cycle 60%, rig up the circuit on a breadboard and by using the probes observe the output of your circuit on the DSO.** 
We understood the working of the 555 timer and constructed the circuit using breadboard and calculated the values of the resistors using the various formulae and used 0.01 micro Farad capacitors. We found that the value of one resistor was double of the other. So, we took the values 3k AND 6k Ohms for the resistors. The duty cycle was 0.6 or 60%

#**Task 14:  Karnaugh Maps and Deriving the logic circuit**
We had to make a burglar alarm on tinkercad. This included 2 switches and 4 cases. One switch representing the door lock and the other representing the key. Based on the conditions, the buzzer makes a sound.[This is the link to my tinkercad circuit](https://www.tinkercad.com/things/6sNyHsLJIUv-super-hillar)

#**Task 15: Active Participation**
I participated in Kagada 2k23 Poster Presentation Competition. I am currently doing a 100 days Udemy course on python.
